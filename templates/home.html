          <p>Data is the new currency, and it’s disrupting virtually every industry. As people become more connected through technology and social media, more data points are available for collection making using data analytics more valuable. In fact, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every 24 hours. That’s 2,500,000,000,000,000,000 bytes of data, to be precise!

            Over 90% of data that exists has been generated only in the past two years. Each data point represents a single user’s action, and a unique narrative will begin to emerge with larger sets of information. Data from the 3.7 billion online users can be used to understand individuals’ unique needs, behaviors and interests. However, data can also be incredibly daunting. Identifying the key performance indicators that are important to your business, sorting through mounds of data to measure the right things, and making sound marketing decisions based on the findings are among the many challenges (and opportunities!) of big data.</p>

              <p>In the marketing and advertising industry, data analytics has become an integral part of strategic development and assessment of any successful marketing campaign. Automated tools enable marketers to track users across platforms, connecting data from multiple online sources – like CRMs, Google Analytics, AdWords, Facebook, internal systems, customer information and hundreds of other sources – giving them a better idea of how users are converting. Combining this information with data analysis tools or machine learning can help you discover new connections and opportunities.</p>
